function all_cells = tgr_loadData2(filepath,expName)

%%% This function is based on Manfred Oswald's analysis and parsing script,
%%% dealing with the CFS data in Ruth Empsons lab (University of Otago) and
%%% has been rewritten by Ivo Sonntag. It depends on the ....
%%% 
%%% Inputs:
%%% filepath -> the path including the filename 
%%% on windows filepath = 'X:\path\filename.cfs' 
%%% on unix filepath = '/home/path/filename.cfs'
%%% This variable has to be a cell array of strings, so that multiple files can be read in.
%%% The function assumes rows of the cell array to contain recordings from different cells, so that each colum of 
%%% a row will be treated as part of one cell and the data will be concatanated. The data inputed will be 
%%% transposed, so that the longest dimension is assumed to be the rows.
%%%
%%% expName -> just a simple string, so the files can later be identified easier
%%%
%%% If no experiment Name is specified, the exName variable will be set to 'random'.
%%% If no directory is specified, a gui is provided (uigetfiles.m Copyright (c) 2007, Douglas M. Schwarz), 
%%% so that a list of files can be picked. This does not support concatanation of recordings.
%%%
%%% Outputs: 
%%% The output is a {1 by number of input rows} cell array for each cell-recording/row. This cell contains a 
%%% structure with 5 fields. 
%%% {1,1}.name is equal to the specified Experiment Name
%%% {1,1}.rawdata is a (m,n) array with length of m corresponding to the number of data samples (1 second of 20KiloHz 
%%%     sampling frequency will return an m of length 20000), and n with a length of the Input cell-recordings/rows.
%%% {1,1}.rawdata
